                      ******* WHAT IS YOUR APPROACH FOR AUTOMATION? *******
        - I read the acceptance criteria carefully
        - I then create my test cases
        - Then I do my manual testing FIRST
        - If all good, then I start complete my automation script
        - If I find a bug/defect, then I talk to dev. Dev fixes the issue, then I retest.
        If all is good then complete my automation script
        - When the automation is complete, I prepare the report for the user story. In fact, My automation script
        generates html reports for us. I upload those reports to the JIRA.
        - For my manual test cases, I manually take screenshots and prepare reports and attach them to the JIRA.

                      ******* WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOUR TEST CASE FAIL? *******
        - Retest to make sure from the failure. It can be data issue, typo, documentation issue or is can be a real bug.
        - If that is a bug, then talk to the dev and let them fix the bug.
        - After the fix, we retest. When test cases passes we upload to JIRA.
